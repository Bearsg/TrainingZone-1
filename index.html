<h2>History</h2>
<p><img src="images/133538_1572.jpg" width="345" height="258" alt=""/>Training Zone  have been the leader in all kinds of training that covers management and IT in  Plongk St, Cairnsville for the last 150 years. The founder of the company,  Touglas Zonas is still CEO and spokesperson for Training Zone. Here is one of  his first ever training lessons, the world-famous <em>Lecture Clash </em>training:<br>
  Anyone got  a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they can be  manageable. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Realise that it's up to you.       You are responsible for making it work. </li>
  <li>Attend one lecture and get the       notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not enough). </li>
  <li>Find a friend in the one you       miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's not on       the web. </li>
  <li>Which one do you miss? - Some       ideas to help you with that decision are: </li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>If you miss one out of two        lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%. </li>
    <li>Which one are you most on top        of? </li>
    <li>Which subject has the most        complete lecture notes? </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Don't ask your lecturer -       &quot;did I miss anything in the lecture?&quot; If you didn't miss       anything, there'd be no point to lectures.</li>
</ul>
